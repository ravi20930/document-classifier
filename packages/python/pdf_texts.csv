Marketplace MVP.pdf,how i created an mvp with a marketplace has been born i love marketplaces multisided platforms are the biggest businesses in the world just look at amazon google airbnb all of them are matchmaking platforms to understand how a marketplace works think of a nightclub girls get in free they may even consume for free if there are girls boys come if boys come they buy alcohol so the business works beware with more boys than girls in the club business will die with this analogy im trying to show you that you need the right balance between both sides of the marketplace to make it work in order to validate a marketplace idea you need to cover aspects technical the platform itself and sales platform population the platform you can use no code tools in order to have your mvp webflow or themeforest are good places to find a template you dont need anything besides a template to start populating both sides of your marketplace if your marketplace starts getting traction you will always be in time to develop something more extensive later on but i can tell even with those templates is enough to create the matchmaking environment you need to generate revenue so it can be more than enough template cost hosting domains and mail adresses per year which would be the next natural step to face the market reality a potential business by four saturdays not going out its worth it dont you think so marketing sales marketplace population based on the actions you will be taken to populate the marketplace stay attentive to understand what works and what you must discard for further actions it will help you to create an optimized funnel also the learning from these actions is crucial to be able to create the no brainer offer you will be polishing your offer and arguments based on those feedbacks your goal is to remove all potential frictions from your speech the more interactions you do the faster you will understand how to convince your prospects in the near future normally first prospects are for burning and for learning they will help you create the perfect speech eg google founders made more than meetings with potential investors till they convinced one,Entertainment & Media
